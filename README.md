Sorry for the inconvenience. If you were using extensionMapping, your list may have disappeared during this update. However, there's no need to worry.

You can find your previously registered mapping information by navigating to your Vault directory and checking the following file:

```
your-vault-directory/.obsidian/plugins/auto_file_organizer/data.json
```

     **Do not include a period (".") in the extension.**
   - In the **Tag-to-Folder Mapping** section, input the tag (e.g., `#test`, `#project`, etc.) and select the target folder.
     **Make sure to include a "#" at the beginning of the tag.**

2. **Edit Existing Mappings**:
   - You can edit or delete existing mappings from the list in the settings.

3. **Priority and Enable/Disable Settings**:

## Notes

This plugin has been tested on Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. However, as it is in the pre-release stage, unexpected behavior may occur.

---

## TODO

This plugin aims to focus solely on the functionality of moving files as specified, and features will be implemented to achieve this goal.

1. Set a rule to priotize tags or extensions, which has less confliction.
2. Apply priority rules when making mappings automatically.
